    <h3> 1.Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.</h3>
    <p>
       
ans-- <br>
 == and === known as comparison operators. <br>
  The difference between == and === is---> <br>
   "==" only used for checks only values, and <br>
    "===" is used to checks both value and datatypes. <br>

var a="10"; <br>
var b=10; <br>
console.log(a==b);   It will returns true because it only check values not data types <br>
console.log(a===b);   It returns false because for a and b values are same but a is string type and b is number type, so that datatypes are not same.

    </p><br>
 
    <h3>
        2. What is the spread operator?
        </h3>
    <p> Ans-- <br>
       (...) Spread operator allows an iterable to expand in places where 0+ arguments are expected. <br>
         It is mostly used in the variable array where there is more than 1 values are expected. <br>
          It allows us the privilege to obtain a list of parameters from an array. <br>
           Syntax of (...) Spread operator is same as Rest parameter but it works completely opposite of it. <br> 

           let arr = ["a","b","c","d"]; <br>
           let arr2 = [1,2,3]; <br> <br>
  
           arr = [...arr,...arr2]; <br>
           console.log(arr); output-['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 1, 2, 3]
    </p>

    <h3>3.What are the differences between var, let and const?</h3>
    <p>
        ans-> <br>
        var is a Global or Functional Scoped.it can be reassigned or redeclared and it can be modified later. <br>
        in other side let and const are block scoped, let and const both cannot be reassigned or redeclare. <br>
        but let can be modified later,<br>
        and const cannot be modified later.

    <h3>4.What is execution context</h3>
    <p>
        Ans-- <br>
        The browser's JavaScript engine then creates a special environment to handle the transformation <br>
         and execution of this JavaScript code. This environment is known as the Execution Context. <br>
         Execution context is defined as the environment in which the JavaScript code is executed. <br>
          By environment, I mean the value of <span style="background-color: red; ">this</span> , variables, objects, and functions JavaScript code has access to at a particular time. <br>
          There are two kinds of Execution Context in JavaScript: <br>
●	Global Execution Context (GEC) <br>
●	Function Execution Context (FEC)

    <h3>5.What is meant by first class functions</h3>
    <p>
        Ans-- <br>
        A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable. <br>
         For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable. <br><br>
         1.Exp- | Assign a function to a variable <br>

const foo = function() { <br>
   console.log("hi there"); <br>
} <br>
foo(); // Invoke it using the variable <br>
// hi there  

    </p>
